# CipherLab Agent Resume Transcript

1. Initially listed workspace directory to confirm Monorepo setup.
2. Ran `npm run test --workspaces`. Found all shared packages pass unit tests successfully.
3. Ran integration tests for backend, ensuring API routes match the contract. Tests passed.
4. Ran Playwright tests but encountered an error regarding missing browsers.
5. Visually verified `hill.ts` and `matrix.ts` implementation:
   - Validated GCD implementation and Modulo logic.
   - Ran `npx tsx test-hill.ts` to log specific Hill cipher test vectors. Both resulted in expected strings/errors.
6. Checked `app.ts` in the Express backend: `helmet`, `cors`, and `express-rate-limit` configurations were present and correct.
7. Evaluated privacy configurations. Updated `BaseCipherUI.tsx` to handle an environment variable `VITE_LOCAL_ONLY` to force completely stateless local processing. Included `.env` file in `apps/frontend/`.
8. Checked `docker-compose.yml` for port alignments and documented them in `README.md`. Docker runtime was absent on Windows host.
9. Reviewed GitHub Actions YAML. Switched `npm audit` to output JSON per user request.
10. Built `CipherLab_resume_snapshot.zip` in Windows staging `C:\tmp`.
11. Initialized git repository locally and pushed changes to the `resume/fixes-2026-02-28` branch representing the PR draft.
